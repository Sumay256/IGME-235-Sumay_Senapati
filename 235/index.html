<h2>About Me</h2>
<div class="bio-box">
  <p>
    Hello, my name is Sumay Senapati, and I'm a second-year student at RIT 
    studying Game Design and Development.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm excited to use this course as a way to build a stronger foundation 
    in web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to learn how 
    design principles can make projects more polished and effective.
  </p>

  <p>
    Looking ahead, I'd like to work in the game industry, creating interactive 
    experiences that are both fun and meaningful. I enjoy combining creativity 
    with problem-solving, and I hope to keep growing those skills throughout 
    my time at RIT.
  </p>
