            <p>
                The goal of this website is to create a visually engaging and easy-to-navigate portfolio 
                site that showcases design work. The primary audience includes potential clients, classmates, 
                and instructors who need to quickly understand my design skills and approach.

            <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
            <p>
                Creating a nav bar with some new effects i had in mind was a bit challenging but fun.
                Some youtube tutorials helped me get the effect i wanted.
                For phase 2, setting up the navbar to function properly and fluidly was a challenge as well as facilitating the breakpoint for a proper mobile viewing experience.
                The footer was also properly implemented with clear styling and contrast alongside some placeholder links.
