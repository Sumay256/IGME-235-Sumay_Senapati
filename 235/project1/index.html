      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome! This portfolio highlights a selection of works that combine design, functionality, and experimentation.
        It reflects an approach focused on building engaging, user-centered experiences while maintaining attention to
        structure and detail. The goal is to continue growing through creative challenges, technical exploration, and
        collaborative projects.
      </p>
      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Below is a selection of featured work, ranging from interactive prototypes to full development pieces. Each
        project focuses on different aspects of design and implementation — whether that's visual layout, motion, or
        user interaction. Together, they represent a range of concepts, workflows, and ideas explored across multiple
        mediums.

        Above is a collection of micellanious works that showcase different styles and techniques. While they are plenty more projects I'd love to showcase,
        these have been specifically picked as they show my progress and growth as a designer and developer in a chronological order.
        Starting from the T-Rex game recreation, my intial foray into game developmnent started of as a collection of various short projects and recreations fo various existing games with this one in particular
        being my first big milestone as it helped me learn responsive design to accomodate all form of screens and devices as well as basic side scroller mechanics.
        Then I moved onto creating some more projects which led me to "Spooderman" a dumb and funny side scroller I decided to make to experiment with some mechanics I had in mind
        which ended up testing all my skills I had developed over that time. After several more smaller projects, I developed a game in monogame called "Where They At",
        one of my first projects made in collaboration with others. It was a fun and intricate projects where algorithms for the game puzzles and systems were key 
        and I learned a lot about teamwork and project management. Finally, the Bonfire project is my latest work where I experimented with 3D design.
