    <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The Amiibo Finder is a web application that allows users to search for Amiibo figures, filter by game
            series, sort by name, and maintain a list of favourites. The application stores the last search term,
            selected filter, and sort option using the browser's local storage, providing a persistent and user-friendly
            experience.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Initial Build vs Final Rework</h2>
        <p>The initial build was a simple search interface similar to the GIF Finder project. The major reworks include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Filter and sort functionality:</strong> Added dropdowns for game series and sorting by name
                (A→Z, Z→A).</li>
            <li><strong>Favourites feature:</strong> Users can add or remove Amiibo to a favourites section. IDs are
                stored in localStorage for persistence.</li>
            <li><strong>Persistent last search:</strong> The search term, filter, and sort selection are saved between
                visits.</li>
            <li><strong>Empty search handling:</strong> Unlike the initial build, users can perform searches using only
                filters without entering a search term.</li>
            <li><strong>Status messages:</strong> Added live feedback for search progress, number of results found, and
                error handling.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These reworks were necessary to align with assignment requirements, including minimum three controls,
            persistent state, and a responsive, user-friendly interface.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Challenges Encountered</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Understanding the structure of the Amiibo API and how to use head and tail fields to create unique IDs
                for favourites.</li>
            <li>Implementing search, filter, and sort in a way that could handle empty searches and persist user
                selections without using advanced JS constructs.</li>
            <li>Ensuring the UI was clean and responsive using Flexbox and CSS Grid while keeping it simple and
                assignment-friendly.</li>
            <li>Managing localStorage for multiple pieces of data (favourites, search term, filter, sort) and ensuring
                proper updates when the user interacts with the app.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Project Process & References</h2>
        <p>The project was developed in several stages to meet the assignment requirements:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Initial Setup:</strong> Created a basic HTML layout with search input, results grid, and
                favourites section. This mimicked the starter template provided in class.</li>
            <li><strong>API Integration:</strong> Explored the Amiibo API documentation to understand endpoints and data
                structure, including fields like name, gameSeries, image,
                head, and tail.</li>
            <li><strong>Search Functionality:</strong> Implemented name-based search using the API. Initially, searches
                required a term, but this was later improved to allow filter-only searches.</li>
            <li><strong>Filter and Sort:</strong> Added dropdowns for game series filtering and sorting by name (A→Z,
                Z→A), with persistent state using localStorage.</li>
            <li><strong>Favourites:</strong> Enabled users to add or remove Amiibo from favourites, saved in
                localStorage for persistence across visits.</li>
            <li><strong>Refinement:</strong> Added status messages, empty search handling, and responsive CSS layout
                with Flexbox and Grid to improve UX and match rubric requirements.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>References & Resources Used:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://amiiboapi.com/docs/" target="_blank">Amiibo API Documentation</a> - Primary reference
                for API endpoints, query parameters, and data structure.</li>
            <li>Class Videos & Web Apps Tutorials - Guidance on search handling, localStorage, DOM manipulation, and
                assignment-specific requirements.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The final Amiibo Finder project demonstrates an improved, interactive user interface with persistent state,
            favourites management, and flexible search capabilities. The project was simplified enough to align with
            class expectations while still implementing key features using the API efficiently. This project highlights
            the importance of API documentation and careful planning in building feature-rich web applications.
