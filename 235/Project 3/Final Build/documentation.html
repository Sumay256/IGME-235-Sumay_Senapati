        <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HP: Health points; increases when HP cards are matched. Max HP is also increased by 5 permanently each
                match.</li>
            <li>Shield: Negates complete damage from enemy cards; consumes 1 shield per dmg negation. Gives a permanent
                Dmg reduction stack (10%) Has a max stack limit of 5.</li>
            <li>Enemies: Grunt and Brute cards deal damage when mismatched. (Grunt deals 2 flat damage and Brute deals 5)</li>
            <li>Levels: Completing all matches advances the player to the next level, increasing
                enemy damage.</li>
            <li>Buffs: Temporary notifications for HP or Shield gains appear above the grid.</li>
            <li>Inert number cards just have to be matched to clear them from the board.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Development Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cards are created dynamically using the DOM, which allows the grid to change every level.</li>
            <li>The HP bar is implemented using a simple inner div. Its width updates based on the player's current HP.</li>
            <li>Buffs like "HP+" and "Shield+" appear temporarily above the grid whenever the player gains a bonus.
                These are added dynamically to the DOM as well.</li>
            <li>Used setTimeout to delay actions like hiding matched cards or flipping back mismatched cards. This
                creates a smooth visual effect and prevents the player from clicking too quickly.</li>
            <li>The deck includes special cards (HP, Shield, enemies) and inert number cards, which are shuffled
                randomly each level to keep the game fresh. The deck is created and shuffled each level.</li>
        </ul>
