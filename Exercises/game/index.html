    Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around.<br>
    The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. [...]</p>

    This definitely goes under the heading of "Games That Were Made While a Programmer Was on Drugs," or at least had a
    good imagination. And maybe they were into horror movies too.<br>
